Detection of traffic congestion

The growing number of vehicles on road has attributed to increased traffic. Even though public transport systems like metro, buses, and trains help in reducing the vehicles on roads but there the problem of traffic congestion is still very prominent. The problem of traffic congestion affects everyone’s life almost on daily basis. It is predicted that by 2040, the number of cars is going to be doubled. Therefore, it is important to understand and try to alleviate the problem. There are several machine learning algorithms used to enhance the accuracy of the prediction. The machine learning algorithm used are linear and logistic regression, K- nearest neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Artificial neural network ANN. Different models produced different levels of efficiency and the best result was produced by an Artificial neural network. This machine- learning algorithm could fetch a precision of 95.1%
